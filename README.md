Horologist is a group of libraries that aim to supplement Wear OS developers with features that are
commonly required by developers but not yet available.

## Maintained Versions

The currently maintained branches of Horologist are.

| Version | Branch        | Min SDK (Wear) | Kotlin/JDK | Description                                                                         |

| 0.6.x   | release-0.6.x | 26             | 1.9.x / 11 | Wear Compose 1.4.x, Compose 1.7.x and recent stable versions of Androidx.           |
| 0.7.x   | main          | 26             | 2.0.x / 17 | Wear Compose 1.5.x, Compose 1.8.x and generally latest relevant alphas of Androidx. |

Maintenance branches will not delete existing APIs and they should remain stable. However
the main branch will actively update to incorporate new API guidance, removing or changing
APIs.

## üéµ Media

Horologist provides the Media Toolkit: a set of libraries to build Media apps on Wear OS and a
sample app that you can run to see the toolkit in action.

The toolkit includes:

- [horologist-media-ui](https://google.github.io/horologist/media-ui): common media UI components
  and screens like `PlayerScreen`.
- [horologist-media](https://google.github.io/horologist/media): domain model for Media related
  functionality. Provides an
  abstraction
  to the UI module (`horologist-media-ui`) that is agnostic to the Player implementation.
- [horologist-media-data](https://google.github.io/horologist/media-data): implementation of the
  domain module (`horologist-media`)
  using [Media3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/media3).
- [horologist-media3-backend](https://google.github.io/horologist/media3-backend): Player on top of
  Media3 including
  functionalities
  such as avoiding playing music on the watch speaker.
- [media sample](https://google.github.io/horologist/media-sample): sample app to listen to
  downloaded music.

## DataLayer

The Horologist DataLayer library, provide common abstractions on top of the
[Wearable DataLayer](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/data/data-layer).
It includes libraries to build
[prompts on the phone](https://google.github.io/horologist/datalayer-phone-ui/) to improve
engagement with the correspondent Wear app and a
[sample](https://google.github.io/horologist/datalayer-sample/) to see the prompts in actions.
Find guidance in the project [documentation](https://google.github.io/horologist/datalayer/).

## ‚ò∞ Tiles

Kotlin coroutines flavoured TileService.

[horologist-tiles](https://google.github.io/horologist/tiles)
