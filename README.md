## üéµ Media

Horologist provides the Media Toolkit: a set of libraries to build Media apps on Wear OS and a sample app that you can run to see the toolkit in action.

The toolkit includes:

- [horologist-media-ui](./media-ui): common media UI components and screens like `PlayerScreen`.
- [horologist-media](./media): domain model for Media related functionality. Provides an abstraction to the UI module (`horologist-media-ui`) that is agnostic to the Player implementation.
- [horologist-media-data](./media-data): implementation of the domain module (`horologist-media`) using [Media3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/media3).
- [horologist-media3-backend](./media3-backend): Player on top of Media3 including functionalities such as avoiding playing music on the watch speaker.
- [horologist-media-sample](./media-sample): sample app to listen to downloaded music.
