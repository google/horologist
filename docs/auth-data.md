# Auth Data

This library contains implementations for Wear apps for most of the authentication methods listed in
the [Authentication on wearables](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/auth-wear)
guide.

The repositories of this library are built mainly to support the components
from [auth-ui](auth-ui.md) library, but can be used with your own UI components.
