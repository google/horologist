# Token sharing guide

This guide will walk you through on how to
securely [transfer authentication data](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/auth-wear#tokens)
from the phone app to the watch app using Horologist's Auth libraries.

## Requirements

Horologist Auth library is built on top
of [Wearable Data Layer API](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/data/data-layer), so
your phone and watch apps must:

- have APK signatures and the signature schemes identical;
- the same package name;

## Getting started

1.  Add dependencies

    Add the following dependencies to your projectâ€™s build.gradle.

    For the phone app project:

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation "com.google.android.horologist:horologist-auth-data-phone:<version>"
        implementation "com.google.android.horologist:horologist-datalayer:<version>"
    }
    ```

    For the watch app project:

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation "com.google.android.horologist:horologist-auth-data:<version>"
        implementation "com.google.android.horologist:horologist-datalayer:<version>"
    }
    ```

1.  Add capability to phone app project

    On the phone app project, add a `wear.xml` file in the `res/values` folder with the following
    content:

    ```xml
    <resources>
        <string-array name="android_wear_capabilities">
            <item>horologist_phone</item>
        </string-array>
    </resources>
    ```

1.  Create a `WearDataLayerRegistry`

    In both projects, create an instance
    of [WearDataLayerRegistry](https://google.github.io/horologist/api/datalayer/com.google.android.horologist.data/-wear-data-layer-registry/index.html)
    from the [datalayer](datalayer.md):

    ```kotlin
    val registry = WearDataLayerRegistry.fromContext(
        application = // application context,
        coroutineScope = // a coroutine scope
    )
    ```

    This class should be created as a singleton in your app.

1.  Define the data to be transferred

    Define which authentication data that should be transferred from the phone to the watch. It can
    be a data class with many properties, it can also be a [protocol buffer](https://protobuf.dev/).
    For this guide, we will pass a simple `String` instance.

1.  Create a `Serializer` for the data

    Create
    a [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) `Serializer`
    class for the class defined to be transferred from the phone to the watch (`String` for this
    guide):

    ```kotlin
    public object TokenSerializer : Serializer<String> {
        override val defaultValue: String = ""
    
        override suspend fun readFrom(input: InputStream): String =
            InputStreamReader(input).readText()
    
        override suspend fun writeTo(t: String, output: OutputStream) {
            withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
                output.write(t.toByteArray())
            }
        }
    }   
    ```

    This class should preferable be placed in a shared module between the phone and watch projects,
    but could also be duplicated in both projects.

    More information about this serialization
    in [this blog post](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/datastore-and-kotlin-serialization-8b25bf0be66c).

## Send authentication data from the phone

1.  Create a `TokenBundleRepository` on the phone project

    Create an instance
    of [TokenBundleRepository](https://google.github.io/horologist/api/auth-data-phone/com.google.android.horologist.auth.data.phone.tokenshare/-token-bundle-repository/index.html)
    on the phone app project:

    ```kotlin
    val tokenBundleRepository = TokenBundleRepositoryImpl(
        registry = registry,
        coroutineScope = // a coroutine scope,
        serializer = TokenSerializer
    )   
    ```

1.  Check if the repository is available (optional)

    Before using the repository, you can check if it is available to be used on the current device
    with:

    ```kotlin
    tokenBundleRepository.isAvailable()
    ```

    If the repository is not available on the device, all the calls to it will fail silently.

    See the requirements
    of [Wearable Data Layer API](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/data/data-layer#send-and-sync-with-API).

1.  Send authentication data

    The authentication data can be sent from the phone calling `update`:

    ```kotlin
    tokenBundleRepository.update("token")
    ```

## Receive authentication data on the watch

1.  Create a `TokenBundleRepository` on the watch project

    Create an instance
    of [TokenBundleRepository](https://google.github.io/horologist/api/auth-data/com.google.android.horologist.auth.data.tokenshare/-token-bundle-repository/index.html)
    on the watch app project:

    ```kotlin
    val tokenBundleRepository = TokenBundleRepositoryImpl.create(
        registry = registry,
        serializer = TokenSerializer
    )
    ```

1.  Receive authentication data

    The authentication data can be listened from the watch via the `flow` property:
    ```kotlin
    tokenBundleRepository.flow
    ```
