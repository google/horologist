# Auth UI

This library contains a set of composables screens and components related to authentication.

The previews of the composables can be found in the `debug` folder of the module source code.

The composables of this module might depend on an implementation of the repositories defined
in [auth-data](auth-data.md) library. Some of them might depend on an external library instead (
e.g. [Identity](https://developers.google.com/identity)).
