# DataLayer phone UI

The DataLayer phone UI library provides an implementation for phone prompts UI that can be used to
bring more users to the Wear app.

## Getting started

Please follow the "Getting started" from the [Datalayer App Helper](datalayer-helpers-guide.md)
guide in order to set up the apps and create an instance
of [PhoneDataLayerAppHelper](https://google.github.io/horologist/api/datalayer/phone/com.google.android.horologist.datalayer.phone/-phone-data-layer-app-helper/index.html).

Also refer to "Check API availability" from the [Datalayer App Helper](datalayer-helpers-guide.md)
guide to check if the required APIs are available.

## Basic usage

```kotlin
val installPrompt = InstallAppPrompt(phoneDataLayerAppHelper = phoneDataLayerAppHelper)

if (installPrompt.shouldDisplayPrompt()) {
    val intent = installAppPrompt.getIntent(
        context = context,
        appPackageName = context.packageName,
        image = R.drawable.image_drawable,
        topMessage = "top message",
        bottomMessage = "bottom message",
    )
    startActivity(intent)
}
```

The code above uses the install prompt as example, but the usage of other prompts are similar.

## Check user's action

In order to check what was the action taken by the user, refer
to [Get a result from an activity](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/result).

For example, if using Compose:

```kotlin
val launcher = rememberLauncherForActivityResult(
        ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult(),
) { result ->
  if (result.resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
    // user pushed install!
  } else {
    // user dismissed the prompt.
  }
}

if (installPrompt.shouldDisplayPrompt()) {
  val intent = installAppPrompt.getIntent(
      context = context,
      appPackageName = context.packageName,
      image = R.drawable.image_drawable,
      topMessage = "top message",
      bottomMessage = "bottom message",
  )
  
  launcher.launch(intent)
}
```

The code above uses the install prompt as example, but the usage of other prompts are similar.

## Install app

Use
the [InstallAppPrompt](https://google.github.io/horologist/api/datalayer/phone-ui/com.google.android.horologist.datalayer.phone.ui.prompt.installapp/-install-app-prompt/index.html)
to build the UI of a prompt to ask the user to install the app on their watch.

The `shouldDisplayPrompt` method allows to check if the prompt should be displayed, based on the
following conditions:

- there is a watch connected
- the app is not installed

The `shouldDisplayPrompt` method is relying on the capability defined in the wear.xml of the Wear
app, if the Wear app is installed
but hasn't been updated with the capability definition, this method may still return
a `AppHelperNodeStatus`
indicating that the Wear app is not installed.

## ReEngage prompt

Use
the [ReEngagePrompt](https://google.github.io/horologist/api/datalayer/phone-ui/com.google.android.horologist.datalayer.phone.ui.prompt.reengage/-re-engage-prompt/index.html)
to build the UI of a prompt to ask the user to install the app on their
watch.

The `shouldDisplayPrompt` method allows to check if the prompt should be displayed, based on the
following conditions:

- there is a watch connected
- the app is installed

## SignIn prompt

Use
the [SignInPrompt](https://google.github.io/horologist/api/datalayer/phone-ui/com.google.android.horologist.datalayer.phone.ui.prompt.signin/-sign-in-prompt/index.html)
to build the UI of a prompt to ask the user to finish the sign in on the
watch.

The `shouldDisplayPrompt` method allows to check if the prompt should be displayed, based on the
following conditions:

- there is a watch connected
- the app is installed
- the app was not marked as "setup complete" (see "Tracking the app has been set up"
  in [Datalayer App Helper](datalayer-helpers-guide.md) guide)

## Install Tile prompt
Use the
[InstallTilePrompt](https://google.github.io/horologist/api/datalayer/phone-ui/com.google.android.horologist.datalayer.phone.ui.prompt.installtile/-install-tile-prompt/index.html)
to build the UI of a prompt to ask the user to install a Tile of your choice on the
watch. If the user decides to install the Tile, they will be redirected to the Tile settings editor 
screen where they can select and add the Tile to the watchface.
Please note that this feature is only supported on Pixel watches.

The `shouldDisplayPrompt` method allows to check if the prompt should be displayed, based on the
following conditions:

- the Wear app is installed and it's tracking the status of installed Tiles. See
[trackInstalledTiles](https://github.com/google/horologist/blob/main/datalayer/sample/wear/src/main/java/com/google/android/horologist/datalayer/sample/TileSync.kt#L35)
in the sample app. The `trackInstalledTiles` has to be called when the app is launched, on 
`TileService.onTileAddEvent` and `TileService.onTileRemoveEvent`. After the Wear app has been updated
to support `trackInstalledTiles`, it has to be launched at least once before being able to track the 
Tile installation status.
- Wear OS companion app has version of 2.1.0.576785526 or above. This version was rolled out in
November 2023.
- We are using `getActiveTilesAsync` method which could omit some Tiles, 
see more in the [doc](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/wear/tiles/TileService#getActiveTilesAsync(android.content.Context,java.util.concurrent.Executor)).

Also note that, if the user has more than one Pixel watches paired with the phone, the prompt
will always redirect to the Tile settings editor of the first paired watch.

## Custom prompts

If desired to display your own custom prompt, this API can still be helpful. 

Use `shouldDisplayPrompt` to check if there conditions to display the prompt are met: 

```kotlin
val installPrompt = InstallAppPrompt(phoneDataLayerAppHelper = phoneDataLayerAppHelper)

if (installPrompt.shouldDisplayPrompt()) {
    // display your own prompt
}
```

When the user tap on the positive button of your prompt, call `performAction`:

```kotlin
installPrompt.performAction(context, context.packageName)
```

The code above uses the install prompt as example, but the usage of other prompts are similar.
