# Media sample app

The goal of this sample is to show how to implement an audio media app for Wear OS, using the
Horologist media libraries, following the design principles described
in [Considerations for media apps](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/principles#media-apps)
.

The app supports listening to downloaded music. It loads
a [music catalog](https://storage.googleapis.com/uamp/catalog.json) from a remote server and allows
the user to browse the albums and songs. Tapping on a song will play it through connected speakers
or headphones. Under the hood it
uses [Media3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/media3).

## Features

The app showcases the implementation of the following features:

- Media playback, restricted to paired Bluetooth devices.
  This is achieved by calling [`setSuppressPlaybackOnUnsuitableOutput`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/media3/exoplayer/ExoPlayer.Builder#setSuppressPlaybackOnUnsuitableOutput(boolean)) method on the `Exoplayer` instance.
- Launch of Wear Output Switcher to connect devices for media playback
- Volume control
- Radial background based on media artwork color palette
- Download media
- API sync with WorkManager
- Network rules
- Splash screen
- Marquee text for song titles
- Tiles

This list is not exhaustive.
