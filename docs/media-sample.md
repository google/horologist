# Media Sample app

This is an example of a media app for Wear OS. It supports listening to downloaded music.

It loads a [music catalog](https://storage.googleapis.com/uamp/catalog.json) from a remote server
and allows the user to browse the albums and songs. Tapping on a song will play it through connected
speakers or headphones. Under the hood it
uses [Media3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/media3).
