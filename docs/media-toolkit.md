# Media Toolkit

## Overview

Horologist provides what it is called the "Media Toolkit": a set of libraries to build media apps on
Wear OS and a sample app that you can run to see the toolkit in action.

The following modules in the Horologist project are part of the toolkit:

- [media-ui](./media-ui): common media UI components and screens like `PlayerScreen`.
- [media](./media): domain model for media related functionality. Provides an abstraction to the UI
  module (`media-ui`) that is agnostic to the `Player` implementation.
- [media-data](./media-data): implementation of the domain module (`media`) using Media3.
- [media3-backend](./media3-backend): `Player` on top of Media3 including functionalities such as
  avoiding playing music on the watch speaker.
- [media-sample](./media-sample): sample app to listen to downloaded music.

## Architecture overview

The Media Toolkit libraries are separated by layers (UI, domain and data) following
the [recommended app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture#recommended-app-arch)
.

The reason for including a domain layer is to provide flexibility to projects to use
the [UI library][ui library] or the [data library][data library] independently.

For example, if your project already contains an implementation for the player and you are only
interested in using the media screens provided by the toolkit, then only
the [UI library][ui library] needs to be added as a dependency. Thus, no extra dependencies (
e.g. [Media3][media3]) will be added to your project.

On the other hand, if your project does not need any of the media screens or media UI components
provided by the [UI library][ui library], and you are only interested in the player implementation,
then only the [data library][data library] needs to be added as a dependency to your project.

## Getting started

The usage of the toolkit will vary according to the requirements of your project.

As per [architecture overview](#architecture-overview), your project might not need to add all the
libraries of the toolkit as dependency. If thatâ€™s the case, refer to the documentation of each
library required to your project for a guide on how to get started.

For a walkthrough on how to build a very simple media application using some libraries of the
toolkit, refer to this [guide](simple-media-app-guide.md).

For good reference on how to use all the libraries available in the toolkit, refer to the code of
the [media-sample][media sample] app.
