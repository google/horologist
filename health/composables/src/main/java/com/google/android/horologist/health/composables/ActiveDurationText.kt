/**
 * Composable to make it easier to create a chronometer from Health Services exercise data.
 *
 * [ActiveDurationText] provides a text-based chronometer, which can be styled using the same means
 * as a [Text] component, and which should only recompose once-per second as the chronometer ticks.
 *
 * Things to note that [ActiveDurationText] aims to workaround:
 *
 * 1.  Health Services does not guarantee [ExerciseUpdate] messages every second, so these must not
 *     be used to drive a ticker.
 * 2.  The ActiveDuration delivered in an [ExerciseUpdate] will not fall on a second-boundary, so
 *     the delivery time of these messages cannot be used to determine when to update any content
 *     on the screen through a ticker.
 *
 * @param checkpoint The checkpoint from the most recent state change. This is supplied in the
 *     [ExerciseUpdate] messages from [ExerciseClient].
 * @param state The current state of the exercise. This is supplied in the [ExerciseUpdate] messages
 *     from [ExerciseClient].
 * @param content The content slot taking a duration.
